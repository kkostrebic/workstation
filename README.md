# Workstation

My personal workstation setup based on Ansible for Debian systems.

This repository provides:

* An automated playbook (`workstation.yml`) to configure system packages, developer tools, desktop components, and user environment.
* A simple bootstrap script (`setup.sh`) that installs dependencies and runs the Ansible playbook.
* Integration with a user’s dotfiles repository for personal configuration (it defaults to my personal dotfiles repo).

## Features

* Adds and configures additional apt repositories.
* Installs a broad set of packages (core, networking, development, desktop, container tools, etc.).
* Sets up Flatpak and a list of Flatpak applications.
* Applies polkit rules for common workstation actions.
* Installs user-level packages across various ecosystems (npm, pip, gem, go, cargo).
* Pulls container images for quick usage.
* Clones and symlinks a user dotfiles repo for personal customizations.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kkostrebic/workstation.git
   cd workstation
   ```

2. Make the setup script executable and run it:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to specify your dotfiles repo and other preferences.

> The script will install ansible-core and required collections, then kick off the main `workstation.yml` playbook. ([GitHub][1])

## Requirements

* Debian based system with `sudo` available.
* Internet connection to fetch packages and repositories.

## Disclaimer

* This repository contains my personal workstation setup used to maintain a consistent development environment across multiple machines.
* It is opinionated and tailored to my workflow. It may require adjustments before being used elsewhere.
* Most parts of this README were generated by AI based on the repository contents.
